This project aims to develop a simple web application using Angular framework that focuses on presenting tabular data with pagination and filtering functionalities. The application will utilize Angular Material for UI components, SCSS for styling, and TypeScript for programming logic.

Features:

Tabular Data Display: The application will display tabular data in a visually appealing format using Angular Material's MatTableModule.

Pagination: Pagination controls will be implemented to allow users to navigate through large datasets efficiently. Angular Material's MatPaginatorModule will be utilized for this purpose.

Filtering: Filtering functionality will be provided to allow users to search and filter data based on specific criteria. Angular Material's MatInputModule and MatTableDataSource filtering capabilities will be leveraged for this feature.

Responsive Design: The application will be designed to be responsive across different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.

SCSS Styling: SCSS preprocessor will be used to enhance the styling of the application, providing flexibility and maintainability in managing CSS styles.

TypeScript Implementation: TypeScript will be used for writing the application logic, providing type safety and improved developer productivity.

Components:

Main Component: This component will serve as the entry point of the application and will include the navigation bar, pagination controls, and the data table component.

Data Table Component: This component will be responsible for rendering the tabular data using Angular Material's MatTableModule. It will also handle pagination and filtering functionalities.

Filter Component: This component will provide UI elements for users to input filter criteria and trigger the filtering process.

Pagination Component: This component will include controls for navigating between pages of data, such as previous, next, and page number selection.
